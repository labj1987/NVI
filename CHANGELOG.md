# Changelog

## 2.5.6 — Fix orphaned .zsync sidecar

- build-appimage.sh renamed only the built .AppImage to its final
  versioned filename; a same-named .zsync sidecar produced by linuxdeploy
  was left under linuxdeploy's original output filename and was never
  renamed or moved. CI's release glob only matches the versioned
  filename pattern, so the .zsync silently never got uploaded even
  after 2.5.5 fixed zsync not being installed. The .zsync is now
  renamed alongside the AppImage.

## 2.5.5 — Fix missing .zsync file

- The build runner never had zsync installed, so linuxdeploy silently
  skipped generating the .zsync file even though UPDATE_INFORMATION was
  already set in 2.5.4 — update-aware tools had nothing to delta-update
  against. zsync is now installed alongside the other build dependencies.

## 2.5.4 — Enable update checking

- Embedded UPDATE_INFORMATION in the AppImage so update-aware tools
  (Gear Lever, AppImageUpdate) can check GitHub Releases for newer
  versions and delta-update via zsync. CI now also uploads the .zsync
  file alongside the AppImage.

## 2.5.3 — Bug fixes and version-string consolidation

- Fixed wrong version being selected when the search filter is active:
  the selection handler indexed the full version list by visible row
  position, so filtering could select (and download) a different driver
  than the one clicked. Selection now looks up the version by the row's
  title.
- The row-selected handler is now connected once instead of on every
  refresh, so handlers no longer accumulate.
- Replaced the 600-second total request timeout with connect and read
  timeouts, so a slow but healthy download of a large .run file is no
  longer killed at the 10-minute mark. Stalled connections still time
  out after 60 seconds without data.
- A file that fails SHA256 verification is now actually deleted, as the
  UI already claimed.
- Removed the Skip X Server Check switch: since the 2.3.0 repo-style
  install the script always passes --no-x-check to the installer, so
  the switch did nothing.
- Fixed the Fedora path never clearing dnf versionlock entries before
  package removal (broken plugin detection).
- Version now lives only in Cargo.toml: the About dialog and HTTP user
  agent read CARGO_PKG_VERSION at compile time, and build-appimage.sh
  parses Cargo.toml. The About dialog previously reported 2.4.0 in the
  2.5.x releases because the hardcoded copies were missed.

## 2.5.2 — New application ID (retroactive entry)

Application ID moved to io.github.labj1987.NVI (polkit action, appdata,
application_id); all machine-specific references removed; .deb packaging
and DBus service file deleted. AppImage is the only distribution format.

## 2.4.0 — Fedora and dnf-based distro support

The install script now detects the package manager (apt vs dnf) and
branches every distro-specific step accordingly: kernel header packages,
clearing conflicting driver packages, initramfs rebuild (`dracut` instead
of `update-initramfs`), and the optional version hold (`dnf versionlock`
instead of `apt-mark hold`). No changes needed to the GUI itself — it
was already package-manager agnostic. Less tested than the Ubuntu path;
if something doesn't work right on Fedora, open an issue.

## 2.3.0 — Repo-style install

The big one. Rethought the install model entirely: instead of tearing down
the graphical session to unload the live kernel module, the installer now
runs with `--allow-installation-with-running-driver` and installs the new
driver to disk while the old one keeps running — exactly like a distro
package upgrade. The switch happens at the next reboot.

- No session teardown, no display manager stops, no black screens
- Reboot Required detection now compares the on-disk module (`modinfo`)
  against the running driver, so pending installs are reported correctly
- Privileged script simplified from ~230 lines of session management to
  ~120 straightforward lines
- Fully verified end to end with a live install

## 2.2.x — Detached-install experiments (superseded)

Attempted to survive session teardown by re-executing the privileged script
into a detached `systemd-run` scope with `IgnoreOnIsolate=true`. Worked, but
2.3.0 made the entire problem unnecessary. Kept in history for reference.

## 2.1.x — Feature releases

- **2.1.4** — Fixed AppImage first-run: root cannot read another user's
  FUSE mount, so privileged files are now staged through /tmp before
  `pkexec` installs them
- **2.1.3** — Module unload retries with process diagnostics (superseded)
- **2.1.2** — Create the download directory if missing
- **2.1.1** — Code-review hardening: `Cargo.lock` pinned for reproducible
  builds; async bridge rewritten from polling timers to
  `tokio::sync::oneshot` + `glib spawn_local`; SHA256 verification streams
  in 1 MiB chunks instead of loading the whole file; DKMS status parser
  rewritten to handle all output formats; archive integrity check moved
  before any destructive step
- **2.1.0** — System info tab (GPU, driver, kernel, DKMS, Secure Boot,
  disk, reboot state); version comparison badges in the browse list;
  pre-install checks; download cancel, speed and ETA; About dialog;
  custom NVI icon set; single-instance fix (Wayland WM_CLASS must match
  the full application ID); AppImage packaging

## 2.0.0 — Rust rebuild

Complete rewrite from Python/GTK4 to Rust + GTK4 + libadwaita. Single
static binary, Tokio async runtime bridged to the glib main loop, `.deb`
packaging.

## 1.x — Original Python version

GTK4 Python GUI with polkit-authorized install script, version browsing,
download with progress, and SHA256 verification (added in 1.2.0).
